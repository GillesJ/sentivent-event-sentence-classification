aapl15	22	Apple made $ 64.1 billion before taxes in fiscal 2017 .	['Profit/Loss']	('Revenue',)	{'Revenue', 'Profit/Loss'}	True	weak						True

aapl15	28	Morgan Stanley ' s Huberty argues that Apple ' s China recovery , which began earlier this year , will be accelerated by a shift to more-expensive phones like the iPhone X .	['Macroeconomics']	('Macroeconomics',)	set()	False							False

aapl15	44	Will Apple ' s ideas outshine Alphabet ' s or Uber ' s ?	['Macroeconomics']	()	{'Macroeconomics'}	True							False
aapl15	45	No one knows .	[]	()	set()	False							False
aapl15	46	Also , Loup ' s forecast suggests the shift toward autonomous cars will be fairly backloaded , hitting critical mass in the 2030s - - likely too late to drive the climb toward Apple ' s $ 2 trillion valuation .	['FinancialReport', 'Macroeconomics']	('SecurityValue',)	{'Macroeconomics', 'FinancialReport', 'SecurityValue'}	True							True
aapl15	47	The best play is to hold Apple shares if you like the iPhone business , and be patient with the rest .	['Rating']	()	{'Rating'}	True							False
aapl15	48	That services will grow steadily is close to a lock .	['Revenue']	()	{'Revenue'}	True							False
aapl15	49	If a tax bill passes , it will help some .	['Macroeconomics']	()	{'Macroeconomics'}	True							False
aapl15	50	With Bank of America Merrill Lynch saying Asian emerging markets face several years of growth before another recession , that rebound in Asia is another decent bet .	['Macroeconomics']	('Macroeconomics',)	set()	False							False

['CSR/Brand', 'Macroeconomics']	('Macroeconomics',)	{'CSR/Brand'}	True	strong		y				False
amzn12	11	But part of the wide interest in an Amazon pharmacy is that the highly regulated drug business has never been particularly transparent .	[]	()	set()	False							False
amzn12	12	At best , U.S . drug pricing is complex ; at worst , it ' s dysfunctional .	[]	()	set()	False							False
